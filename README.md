# malicious-ip-checker

## CLI that uses 3rd party APIs like VirusTotal, AlienVault, IBMXforce etc to tell whether an IP is malicious or not based on the IPs history thats there in these 3rd party APIs databases.

### Based on the information that these APIs give, this application gives a CSV where there are IP addresses and the Risk Score on a scale of 0-10 where 0 means its not malicious or there are no previous malicious activities registered from the firewall of these APIs and 10 means that its highly malicious.
